FTSCoreDataSource
--------

FTSCoreDataSource is a data source for a `UITableView` that's backed by a Core Data model.  It removes much of the boilerplate involved in getting a `UITableView` setup with an `NSFetchedResultsController`.

## Usage

To use FTSCoreDataSource, simply add `FTSCoreDataSource.h` and `FTSCoreDataSource.m` to your project and call the designated initializer for `FTSCoreDataSource` in the view controller you wish you use it in.  There is also an included example project that demonstrates how to set it up and use it.
